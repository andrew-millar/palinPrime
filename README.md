# Paladin Prime numbers

I read a newspaper article about the strainge fact that for some 
reason there are no prime numbers for all the numbers between 1000 
and 10000 which are also paladindrome numbers. So numbers that are 
the same number read from front to back and from back to front. 
For example 51215 or 7227.
For some reason I fealt the need to write a program to prove this, 
and see if it was faster to first calculate the prime or first the 
palindrome
